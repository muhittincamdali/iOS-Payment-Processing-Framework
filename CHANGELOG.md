## Migration Guide

### From 0.9.0 to 1.0.0

The 1.0.0 release introduces breaking changes to improve the API design and security:

#### PaymentProcessor Initialization

**Before:**
```swift
let processor = PaymentProcessor(merchantId: "id", apiKey: "key")
```

**After:**
```swift
let processor = PaymentProcessor(
    configuration: PaymentConfiguration(
        merchantId: "id",
        apiKey: "key",
        environment: .production
    )
)
```

#### Payment Request

**Before:**
```swift
let request = PaymentRequest(amount: 100, currency: "USD")
```

**After:**
```swift
let request = PaymentRequest(
    amount: 100,
    currency: .usd,
    paymentMethod: .creditCard,
    description: "Payment description"
)
```

#### Error Handling

**Before:**
```swift
processor.processPayment(request) { transaction, error in
    if let error = error {
        // Handle error
    }
}
```

**After:**
```swift
processor.processPayment(request) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let transaction):
        // Handle success
    case .failure(let error):
        // Handle error
    }
}
```

### From 0.8.0 to 0.9.0

No breaking changes. All APIs remain compatible.

### From 0.7.0 to 0.8.0

Minor API improvements with backward compatibility.

## Deprecation Notices

### Version 1.0.0

The following APIs have been deprecated and will be removed in version 2.0.0:

- `PaymentProcessor.init(merchantId:apiKey:)` - Use `PaymentProcessor.init(configuration:)` instead
- `PaymentRequest.init(amount:currency:)` - Use the full initializer with required parameters
- `processPayment(_:completion:)` with tuple return - Use the Result-based API instead

### Version 0.9.0

No deprecations in this version.
